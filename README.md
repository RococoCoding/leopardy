# Leopardy!
**Timeline**: Ongoing 
**Tech**: HTML, CSS, JS, React, Redux, Node, Express, Python
**Description**: Leopard-themed trivia game    
**Contribution Type**: Personal project  
**Status**: Active development 
**Summary**: Yes, this is based off a silly joke, but it's also been a true learning experience. I was able to find two Jeopardy! APIs and fetch questions from them, but neither of them did quite what I wanted, so I decided I'd look up how to make a web scraper and make my own API. I discovered why there weren't more Jeopardy APIs out there when I discovered the jArchive site was still using tables to layout everything. It was a huge pain to get what I needed and I even learned a tiny bit of regex along the way. Once I was able to get some good data, I then had to figure out how to import it into a database. We had learned SQLite3 in school, but I went with Postgres because it's better for bigger projects and I knew I was going to have a LOT of data. 406k rows, in fact. I've never felt such POWER seeing that many entries in a database and being able to search through them with SQL in seconds. I can see the appeal of data science now.

**Next Steps**: I need to write up my API, which should be quick. I only need to serve random questions and set up some endpoints for user data -- That was a late add-on to the original plan, but I think it will be more fun if people can track their stats. 


To-do List:
- Ensure multimedia clues are displayed properly  
- Select difficulty?   
- Create user
- Send game stats to backend
- Add top ten?  
- Styling  
  - Fix grid  
  - Responsiveness
